### Kaggle Dataset

## Attribution Required
When using NIH images, include:
- Link to NIH download site
- Citation to Wang et al., CVPR 2017

## Demo Scenario
For the competition demo, use an image that shows:
- Chest X-ray with subtle findings (e.g., small nodule, mild infiltrate)
- This allows MedGemma to demonstrate "missed diagnosis" detection
